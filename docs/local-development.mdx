# Local development

It is possible to run **web applications** (running with the FPM runtime) locally.

<Callout>
    To run **event-driven functions** locally, read [Local development for event-driven functions](./local-development/event-driven-functions.mdx) instead.
</Callout>

## The simple way

To keep things simple, you can run your applications locally like you did without Bref.

<Tabs items={['Laravel', 'Symfony', 'PHP']}>
<Tab>
    With **Laravel**, run HTTP applications locally using `php artisan serve`, [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/valet), or [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/sail).

    You can test CLI commands locally by running them in your terminal using `php artisan my-command`.
</Tab>
<Tab>
    With **Symfony**, run HTTP applications locally using `symfony server:start` ([documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/symfony_server.html)).

    You can test CLI commands locally by running them in your terminal using `bin/console my-command`.
</Tab>
<Tab>
    Run your HTTP applications locally via your preferred method to run PHP: Apache, WAMP, or even the built-in PHP server:

    ```bash
    php -S localhost:8000
    # The application is now available at http://localhost:8000/
    ```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Docker

In order to run the application locally in an environment closer to production, you can run your application using the [Bref Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/u/bref). For example, create the following `docker-compose.yml`:

```yml filename="docker-compose.yml"
version: "3.5"

services:
    app:
        image: bref/php-84-fpm-dev:3
        ports: [ '8000:8000' ]
        volumes:
            - .:/var/task
        environment:
            HANDLER: public/index.php
            # Assets will be served from this directory
            DOCUMENT_ROOT: public
```

You can then run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).

The `HANDLER` environment variable lets you define which PHP file will be handling all HTTP requests. This should be the same handler that you have defined in `serverless.yml` for your HTTP function.

> Currently, the Docker image support only one PHP handler. If you have multiple HTTP functions in `serverless.yml`, you can duplicate the service in `docker-compose.yml` to have one container per lambda function.

### Read-only filesystem

The code will be mounted in `/var/task`, just like in Lambda. But in Lambda, `/var/task` is read-only.

When developing locally, it is common to regenerate cache files on the fly (for example Symfony or Laravel cache). You have 2 options:

- either mount the whole codebase as writable (per the example above):

    ```yaml filename="docker-compose.yml"
            volumes:
                - .:/var/task
    ```
- or mount a specific cache directory as writable (better):

    ```yaml filename="docker-compose.yml" {3}
            volumes:
                - .:/var/task:ro
                - ./storage:/var/task/storage
    ```

### Assets

If you want to serve assets locally, you can define a `DOCUMENT_ROOT` environment variable:

```yaml {6,7} filename="docker-compose.yml"
services:
    app:
        # ...
        environment:
            HANDLER: public/index.php
            # Assets will be served from this directory
            DOCUMENT_ROOT: public
```

In the example above, a `public/assets/style.css` file will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/assets/style.css`.

<Callout>
    Be aware that serving assets in production will not work like this out of the box. You will need [to use an S3 bucket](./use-cases/websites.mdx).
</Callout>

### Console commands

You can run console commands in Docker via:

```bash
# Laravel (artisan)
docker-compose run app php artisan ...

# Symfony (bin/console)
docker-compose run app php bin/console ...
```

### Xdebug

The development container (`bref/php-<version>-fpm-dev`) comes with Xdebug pre-installed.

To enable it, create a `php/conf.dev.d/php.ini` file in your project containing:

```ini filename="php/conf.dev.d/php.ini"
zend_extension=xdebug.so
```

Now start the debug session by issuing a request to your application [in the browser](https://xdebug.org/docs/remote#starting).

#### Xdebug and MacOS

Docker for Mac uses a virtual machine for running docker. That means you need to use a special host name (`host.docker.internal`) that is mapped to the host machine's IP address.

Edit the `php/conf.dev.d/php.ini` file:

```ini filename="php/conf.dev.d/php.ini" {3-6}
zend_extension=xdebug.so

[xdebug]
xdebug.remote_enable = 1
xdebug.remote_autostart = 0
xdebug.remote_host = 'host.docker.internal'
```

### Blackfire

The development container (`bref/php-<version>-fpm-dev`) comes with the [blackfire](https://www.blackfire.io/) extension. When using docker compose, you can add the following service for the blackfire agent:

```yml filename="docker-compose.yml"
services:
    blackfire:
        image: blackfire/blackfire
        environment:
            BLACKFIRE_SERVER_ID: server-id
            BLACKFIRE_SERVER_TOKEN: server-token
```

In order to enable the probe you can create a folder `php/conf.dev.d` in your project and include an ini file enabling blackfire:

```ini filename="php/conf.dev.d/php.ini"
extension=blackfire
blackfire.agent_socket=tcp://blackfire:8707
```

For more details about using blackfire in a docker environment see the [blackfire docs](https://blackfire.io/docs/integrations/docker)
