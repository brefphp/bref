# Advanced HTTP use-cases

<Callout>
    If you are getting started with Bref, read the guides for **Laravel** ([Get started](../laravel/getting-started.mdx)), **Symfony** ([Get started](../symfony/getting-started.mdx)), or other PHP frameworks ([Get started](../default/getting-started.mdx)).

    This documentation is for advanced use-cases.
</Callout>

## Alternative AWS architectures

By default, Bref uses API Gateway v2 HTTP APIs to run HTTP applications.

However, there are other ways to run HTTP applications on AWS Lambda: using [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [Lambda Function URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-urls.html), or [AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html):

- API Gateway v1 "REST" + Lambda
- API Gateway v2 "HTTP" + Lambda
- Lambda Function URL
- AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer) + Lambda

Bref supports all 4, but API Gateway v2 "HTTP" is the default because it is the simplest option that supports both HTTP APIs and websites with custom domains.

<Callout>
    If you are getting started, **stay with the defaults**. The documentation and integrations will be much simpler to follow.

    You can change the architecture later if you need to.
</Callout>

Here is a summary of the differences between the 4 options:

|                                 |  API Gateway v1 REST  |      API Gateway v2 HTTP      |           Function URL           |       ALB        |

You can read more details [in the "Choosing between REST APIs and HTTP APIs" AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-vs-rest.html).

### API Gateway v2 HTTP API

The simplest way to set up API Gateway is to have all incoming requests sent to our application in one Lambda function:

```yml filename="serverless.yml"
functions:
    hello:
        handler: index.php
        # ...
        events:
            - httpApi: '*'
```

That works well with frameworks like Symfony or Laravel that have a single entrypoint (e.g. `public/index.php`) combined with the [PHP-FPM runtime](../runtimes/fpm-runtime.mdx).

You can look at more advanced API Gateway routing options in the [serverless documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/http-api).

### Lambda Function URLs

Since 2022, AWS Lambda can respond to HTTP requests via [Lambda Function URLs](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-aws-lambda-function-urls-built-in-https-endpoints-for-single-function-microservices/). This is a new way to invoke Lambda functions via HTTP without using API Gateway.

You can deploy a Lambda Function URL [via the following configuration](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/functions#lambda-function-urls):

```yml filename="serverless.yml"
functions:
    hello:
        handler: index.php
        # ...
        url: true
```

### API Gateway v1 REST API

The syntax is slightly different from API Gateway v2 HTTP APIs as we must use a different `events` configuration. Here is an example that sends all requests to a single Lambda function:

```yml filename="serverless.yml"
functions:
    hello:
        handler: index.php
        # ...
        events:
            - http: 'ANY /'
            - http: 'ANY /{proxy+}'
```

Learn more [in the Serverless Framework documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway).

### Application Load Balancer

Application Load Balancer (ALB) is a managed load balancer that can be used to route HTTP requests to Lambda functions. It is a more advanced option that is interesting at high scale as ALB can be much cheaper than API Gateway.

```yml filename="serverless.yml"
functions:
    hello:
        handler: index.php
        # ...
        events:
            -   alb:
                    listenerArn: arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:12345:listener/app/my-load-balancer/50dc6c495c0c9188/
                    priority: 1
                    conditions:
                        path: '/*'
```

## PHP handlers

<Callout>
    This section applies to all 4 approaches: API Gateway v1, v2, ALB, and Function URLs.

    Bref abstracts the differences so that the same code can be used with all 4 solutions.
</Callout>

There are two ways to handle HTTP events with PHP:

- via the [PHP-FPM runtime](../runtimes/fpm-runtime.mdx) (simplest, this is Bref's default)
- via the [Event-Driven Function runtime](../runtimes/function.mdx) (more advanced)

Here is a full comparison between both approaches:

|                                                    | PHP-FPM runtime                                                                                                                | Event-Driven Function handler                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| What are the use cases?                            | To build websites, APIs, etc. This should be the **default approach** as it's compatible with mature PHP frameworks and tools. | Build event-driven microservices, or run Laravel Octane, or Symfony with a keep-alive process (like Roadrunner/Swoole). |
| Why does that solution exist?                      | For out-of-the-box compatibility with existing applications and frameworks.                                                    | To match how other languages run in AWS Lambda, i.e. to build very specialized HTTP endpoints.                          |
| How it runs under the hood                         | Using PHP-FPM.                                                                                                                 | Using the PHP CLI.                                                                                                      |
| What does the routing (i.e. separate pages)?       | Your PHP framework (one Lambda receives all the URLs).                                                                         | API Gateway: we define one Lambda and one handler class per route.                                                      |
| How to read the request?                           | `$_GET`, `$_POST`, etc.                                                                                                        | The `$request` parameter (PSR-7 request).                                                                               |
| How to write a response?                           | `echo`, `header()` function, etc.                                                                                              | Returning a PSR-7 response from the handler class.                                                                      |
| How does it work?                                  | Bref turns an API Gateway event into a FastCGI (PHP-FPM) request.                                                              | Bref turns an API Gateway event into a PSR-7 request.                                                                   |
| Is each request handled in a separate PHP process? | Yes (that's how PHP-FPM works).                                                                                                | Yes by default (Bref replicates that to avoid surprises) but can be disabled for optimal performances.                  |

### With the PHP-FPM runtime

This is perfect for most use-cases: **PHP works like on any server** with PHP-FPM. HTTP routing based on the URL is done by the application/the framework.

This approach is already covered by most of the Bref documentation, so we won't go into details here.

You can read more about [the PHP-FPM runtime here](../runtimes/fpm-runtime.mdx).

### With the Event-Driven Function runtime

This is more advanced, as PHP does not run in a traditional PHP-FPM environment. It can be used with or without a PHP framework.

When used with a framework, understand that the whole HTTP stack (like HTTP middlewares) of the framework does not run. You are responsible for invoking the PHP code that should run.

<Callout>
    Note: this approach is used to run Laravel Octane or Symfony with a keep-alive process (like Roadrunner/Swoole). These use cases are not detailed here, read [about Laravel Octane](../laravel/octane.mdx) or [about Symfony Runtime](../symfony/keep-alive.mdx) instead.
</Callout>

The `handler` must be a PHP function, or a PSR-15 implementation. Indeed, Bref natively supports the [PSR-15](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-15/#2-interfaces) and [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) standards. Here is an example:

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Nyholm\Psr7\Response;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Psr\Http\Server\RequestHandlerInterface;

class MyHttpHandler implements RequestHandlerInterface
{
    public function handle(ServerRequestInterface $request): ResponseInterface
    {
        $name = $request->getQueryParams()['name'] ?? 'world';

        return new Response(200, [], "Hello $name");
    }
}
```

Then, create a Lambda function that listens to HTTP events with the handler you created:

<Tabs items={['Laravel', 'Symfony', 'PHP']}>
    <Tab>
        ```yml filename="serverless.yml"
        functions:
            # ...
            handler: App\MyHttpHandler
            runtime: php-81
            # Lambda Function URL
            url: true
            # Or API Gateway
            events:
                # API Gateway v2
                - httpApi: 'GET /hello'
                # API Gateway v1
                - http: 'GET hello'
        ```

        The `App\MyHttpHandler` class will be instantiated by Laravel's service container.
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```yml filename="serverless.yml"
        functions:
            # ...
            handler: App\MyHttpHandler
            runtime: php-81
            # Lambda Function URL
            url: true
            # Or API Gateway
            events:
                # API Gateway v2
                - httpApi: 'GET /hello'
                # API Gateway v1
                - http: 'GET hello'
        ```

        The `App\MyHttpHandler` class will be instantiated by Symfony's service container.
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```yml filename="serverless.yml"
        functions:
            # ...
            handler: handler.php
            runtime: php-81
            # Lambda Function URL
            url: true
            # Or API Gateway
            events:
                # API Gateway v2
                - httpApi: 'GET /hello'
                # API Gateway v1
                - http: 'GET hello'
        ```

        The file `handler.php` should return the handler instance:

        ```php filename="handler.php"
        <?php

        require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

        return new MyHttpHandler();
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

Since a handler is a controller for a specific route, we can use the API Gateway routing to deploy multiple functions:

```yaml
functions:
    create-article:
        handler: App\CreateArticleController
        runtime: php-81
        events:
            - httpApi: 'POST /articles'
    get-article:
        handler: App\GetArticleController
        runtime: php-81
        events:
            - httpApi: 'GET /articles/{id}'
```

Path parameters (e.g. `{id}` in the example above) are available as request attributes in the PSR-7 request:

```php
$id = $request->getAttribute('id');
```

[Full reference of HTTP events in `serverless.yml`](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/http-api/).

#### Lambda event and context

The API Gateway event and Lambda context are available as attributes on the PSR-7 request:

```php
/** @var $event Bref\Event\Http\HttpRequestEvent */
$event = $request->getAttribute('lambda-event');

/** @var $context Bref\Context\Context */
$context = $request->getAttribute('lambda-context');
```

If you're looking for the request context array, for example when using a [Lambda authorizer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-lambda-authorizer.html#http-api-lambda-authorizer.payload-format-response):

```php
$requestContext = $request->getAttribute('lambda-event')->getRequestContext();
```

## Cold starts

AWS Lambda automatically destroys Lambda containers that have been unused for 10 minutes. Warming up a new container can take 250ms or more, especially if your application is large. This delay is called [cold start](https://mikhail.io/serverless/coldstarts/aws/).

To mitigate cold starts for HTTP applications, you can periodically send an event to your Lambda including a `{warmer: true}` payload. This will trigger the Lambda function. Bref recognizes this event and immediately responds with a `Status: 100` without executing your code.

You can set up such events using a schedule ([read this article for more details](https://www.jeremydaly.com/lambda-warmer-optimize-aws-lambda-function-cold-starts/)):

```yml filename="serverless.yml"
        events:
            - httpApi: '*'
            - schedule:
                rate: rate(5 minutes)
                input:
                    warmer: true
```
