AWS Lambda lets us run [console commands](/docs/runtimes/console.md) as cron tasks using the `schedule` event:

```yaml
functions:
    cron:
        handler: bin/console # or 'artisan' for Laravel
        layers:
            - ${bref:layer.php-74} # PHP runtime
            - ${bref:layer.console} # Console layer
        events:
            - schedule:
                  rate: rate(1 hour)
                  input: '"list --verbose"'
```

The example above will run the `bin/console list --verbose` command every hour in AWS Lambda.

Note that the command **is a double quoted string**: `'"command"'`.
Why? The `input` value needs to be valid JSON, which means that it needs to be a JSON string, stored in a YAML string.

Read more about the `schedule` feature in the [Serverless documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/schedule/).
