There is no built-in support for PHP on AWS Lambda. Instead, we can use 3rd party runtimes via [AWS Lambda *layers*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html).

Bref provides the runtimes (or "layers") to run PHP on Lambda.

## Bref runtimes

Bref provides 2 main runtimes:

- The "FPM" runtime, to create **web applications**.
- The "function" runtime, to create **event-driven functions**.

You can see in the documentation menu how these two runtimes are used to for two different kinds of applications.

### Web apps: `php-74-fpm` and `php-73-fpm`

This runtime uses PHP-FPM to run **web applications** on AWS Lambda.

It's **the easiest to start with**: it works like traditional PHP hosting and is compatible with Symfony and Laravel.

[Get started with the FPM runtime in "Bref for web apps"](/docs/runtimes/http.md).

### Event-driven functions: `php-74` and `php-73`

AWS Lambda was initially created to run _functions_ (yes, functions of code) in the cloud.

The Bref function runtime lets you create Lambda functions in PHP like with any other language.

This runtime works great to create **event-driven micro-services**.

[Get started with the Function runtime in "Bref for event-driven functions"](/docs/runtimes/function.md).

### Console: `console`

This runtime lets use run console commands on Lambda.

For example, we can run the [Symfony Console](https://symfony.com/doc/master/components/console.html) or [Laravel Artisan](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/artisan).

[Read more about the `console` runtime here](/docs/runtimes/console.md).

## Usage

To use a runtime, import the corresponding layer in `serverless.yml`:

```yaml
service: app
provider:
    name: aws
    runtime: provided.al2
plugins:
    - ./vendor/bref/bref
functions:
    hello:
        ...
        layers:
            - ${bref:layer.php-74}
            # or:
            - ${bref:layer.php-74-fpm}
```

The `${...}` notation is the [syntax to use variables](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/variables/) in `serverless.yml`. Bref provides a serverless plugin ("`./vendor/bref/bref`") that provides those variables:

- `${bref:layer.php-74}`
- `${bref:layer.php-73}`
- `${bref:layer.php-74-fpm}`
- `${bref:layer.php-73-fpm}`
- `${bref:layer.console}`
- `${bref:layer.php-80}`
- `${bref:layer.php-80-fpm}`

Bref currently provides runtimes for PHP 7.3 and 7.4. It also provides **experimental** runtimes for PHP 8.0.

> `php-74` means PHP 7.4.\*. It is not possible to require a specific "patch" version.

## Lambda layers in details

Bref runtimes are [AWS Lambda layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html). While Bref provides a Serverless plugin to simplify how to use them, you can use the layers directly.

The layers names follow this pattern:

```
arn:aws:lambda:<region>:209497400698:layer:<layer-name>:<layer-version>
```

To use them manually you need to use that full name. For example in `serverless.yml`:

```yaml
service: app
provider:
    name: aws
    runtime: provided.al2
functions:
    hello:
        ...
        layers:
            - 'arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:209497400698:layer:php-73:7'
```

Or if you are using [SAM's `template.yaml`](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/):

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
Resources:
    Hello:
        Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
        Properties:
            ...
            Runtime: provided.al2
            Layers:
                - 'arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:209497400698:layer:php-73:7'
```

Bref layers work with AWS Lambda regardless of the tool you use to deploy your application: Serverless, SAM, CloudFormation, Terraform, AWS CDK, etc.

> Remember: the layer ARN contains a region. **You need to use the same region as the rest of your application** else Lambda will not find the layer.

### Layer version (`<layer-version>`)

The latest of runtime versions can be found at [runtimes.bref.sh](https://runtimes.bref.sh/) and is shown below:

### Bref ping

Bref layers send a ping to estimate the total number of Lambda invocations powered by Bref. That statistic is useful in two ways:

- to provide new users an idea on how much Bref is used in production
- to communicate to AWS how much Bref is used and push for better PHP integration with AWS Lambda tooling

We consider this to be beneficial both to the Bref project (by getting more users and more consideration from AWS) and for Bref users (more users means a larger community, a stronger and more active project, as well as more features from AWS).

#### What is sent

The data sent in the ping is completely anonymous. It does not contain any identifiable data about anything (the project, users, etc.).

The only data it contains is: "A Bref invocation happened".

Anyone can inspect the code and the data sent by checking the [`Bref\Runtime\LambdaRuntime::ping()` function](https://github.com/brefphp/bref/blob/master/src/Runtime/LambdaRuntime.php#L328).

#### How is it sent

The data is sent via the [statsd](https://github.com/statsd/statsd) protocol, over [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol).

Unlike TCP, UDP does not check that the message correctly arrived to the server.
It doesn't even establish a connection. That means that UDP is extremely fast:
the data is sent over the network and the code moves on to the next line.
When actually sending data, the overhead of that ping takes about 150 micro-seconds.

However, this function actually sends data every 100 invocation, because we don't
need to measure *all* invocations. We only need an approximation.
That means that 99% of the time, no data is sent, and the function takes 30 micro-seconds.
If we average all executions, the overhead of that ping is about 31 micro-seconds.
Given that it is much much less than even 1 milli-second, we consider that overhead negligible.

#### Disabling

The ping can be disabled by setting a `BREF_PING_DISABLE` environment variable to `1`.
