# PHP functions runtime for AWS Lambda

Bref's **"Event-driven function" runtime** lets you run PHP functions on AWS Lambda.

Unlike the [PHP-FPM runtime](./fpm-runtime.mdx), the function runtime does not use PHP-FPM. Instead, it invokes your PHP code directly with the AWS Lambda event.

Here is an example of a PHP Lambda function written as an anonymous function:

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

return function ($event) {
    return 'Hello ' . ($event['name'] ?? 'world');
};
```

This form is very similar to lambdas written in other languages, [for example JavaScript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-prog-model-handler.html):

```javascript
exports.myHandler = async function (event, context) {
   return "Hello " + event.name;
}
```

Writing functions is very useful to process events and data from other AWS services.
For example, this is perfect to implement **asynchronous workers, event handling, file processing**, etc. Plenty of examples are available in the "Use cases" section in the menu.

    If you are creating HTTP applications, the [PHP-FPM runtime](./fpm-runtime.mdx) is a simpler option.

## Usage

To deploy a PHP function on AWS Lambda, use the `php-xx` runtime:

```yaml
service: app
provider:
    name: aws
plugins:
    - ./vendor/bref/bref
functions:
    hello:
        handler: my-function.php
        runtime: php-81
```

## PHP functions

Functions that can run on Lambda can be an anonymous function or [any kind of callable supported by PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.callable.php).

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

return function ($event) {
    return /* result */;
};
```

The function:

- takes an `$event` parameter which contains data from the event that triggered the function ([list of examples here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/eventsources.html))
- can optionally return a result: the result must be serializable to JSON

There can only be one function returned per PHP file.

### Context

The function is invoked with the `$event` parameter as well as a `$context` parameter. This parameter can be optionally declared if you want to use it:

```php
<?php

use Bref\Context\Context;

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

return function ($event, Context $context) {
    return /* result */;
};
```

The `Context` object is inspired from the [`context` parameter in other languages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-prog-model-context.html) and provides information about the current lambda invocation (the request ID, the X-Ray trace ID, etc.).

## PHP classes

As mentioned above, Lambda handlers can be functions or any kind of callable supported by PHP. That means you can write them as PHP classes.

The simplest option is to implement the `Bref\Event\Handler` interface. This is a generic interface to handle any kind of event.

```php
<?php

use Bref\Context\Context;

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

class Handler implements \Bref\Event\Handler
{
    public function handle($event, Context $context)
    {
        return 'Hello ' . $event['name'];
    }
}

return new Handler();
```

Bref also provides more specific abstract classes that you can extend. These let you get type-hinted events with autocompletion and type safety.

Explore the "**Use cases**" section in the left menu to learn more.

### Autoloading

As you can see in the example above, we define the class in the "handler" file, i.e. the same file where we `return new Handler()`.

But we can perfectly move that class to another directory, Composer will autoload it as usual:

```php filename="my-function.php"
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

// The class is stored in `src/` or `app/` and autoloaded by Composer
return new \MyApp\Handler();
```

What is important is to configure `serverless.yml` to use the file that returns the handler:

```yml filename="serverless.yml"
# ...

functions:
    hello:
        handler: my-function.php # the file that returns the handler
```

### DI container integration

It is also possible to directly define PHP classes as AWS Lambda handlers.

<Tabs items={['Laravel', 'Symfony', 'PHP']}>
    <Tab>
        Set the class name as the `handler` and Bref will retrieve that class from Laravel's service container.

        ```yml filename="serverless.yml"
        functions:
            hello:
                handler: MyApp\Handler
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>        
        Create a file that returns the Symfony Kernel (MUST be located at `public/index.php`)
        ```php filename="public/index.php"
        <?php 

        use App\Kernel;
        
        require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
        
        return function () {
            return new Kernel(
                debug: (bool) $_SERVER['APP_DEBUG'],
                environment: $_SERVER['APP_ENV'],
            );
        };
        ```

        Next, set the class name as the `handler` and Bref will retrieve that class from Symfony's service container.

        ```yml filename="serverless.yml"
        functions:
            hello:
                handler: MyApp\Handler
        ```

        Make sure the handler has been registered as public or you will get an error that the service or alias has been removed.
        ```diff filename="src/Handler.php"
        namespace App;

        use Bref\Context\Context;
        + use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Attribute\Autoconfigure;
        
        + #[Autoconfigure(public: true)]
        class Handler implements \Bref\Event\Handler
        {
            public function handle($event, Context $context): string
            {
                // ...
            }    
        }
        ```        
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        To achieve that, you must integrate Bref with your framework's Dependency Injection Container.

        First, create a file (for example `init.php`) that calls `Bref::setContainer()`:

        ```php
        <?php
        use Bref\Bref;

        Bref::setContainer(function () {
            // Retrieve the DI container from your application
            $container = /* */;
            // This should be an instance of a PSR-11 container
            // i.e. it should implement ContainerInterface

            return $container;
        });
        ```

        Next, configure Composer to always load this file:

        ```json filename="composer.json"
        {
            "autoload": {
                "psr-4": {
                    // ...
                },
                "files": [
                    "init.php"
                ]
            },
        }
        ```

        You can now set class names as the `handler` and Bref will retrieve that class from your service container.

        ```yml filename="serverless.yml"
        functions:
            hello:
                handler: MyApp\Handler
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Invocation

A PHP function must be invoked via the AWS Lambda API, either manually or by integrating with other AWS services.

<Callout>
    If you instead want to write a classic **HTTP application**, use the [PHP-FPM runtime](./fpm-runtime.mdx) instead.
</Callout>

### CLI

A PHP function can be triggered manually from the CLI using the [`serverless invoke` command](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/invoke/):

```bash
$ serverless invoke -f <function-name>
# The function name is the one in serverless.yml, in our example that would be `hello`:
$ serverless invoke -f hello
"Hello world"
```

To pass event data to the lambda use the `--data` option. For example:

```bash
serverless invoke -f <function-name> --data='{"name": "John" }'
```

Run `serverless invoke --help` to learn more about the `invoke` command.

### From PHP applications

A PHP function can be triggered from another PHP application using the AWS PHP SDK:

You first need to install the AWS PHP SDK by running

```bash
$ composer require aws/aws-sdk-php
```

```php
$lambda = new \Aws\Lambda\LambdaClient([
    'version' => 'latest',
    'region' => '<region>',
]);

$result = $lambda->invoke([
    'FunctionName' => '<function-name>',
    'InvocationType' => 'RequestResponse',
    'LogType' => 'None',
    'Payload' => json_encode(/* event data */),
]);

$result = json_decode($result->get('Payload')->getContents(), true);
```

<Callout>
    **Important**: When invoking Lambda functions, use the exact function name as it appears in the AWS console, not the function name from `serverless.yml`. For example, if your service is named `my-app` and your function is named `hello`, the actual Lambda function name will be `my-app-dev-hello` (or similar, depending on your stage).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
    A lighter alternative to the official AWS PHP SDK is the [AsyncAws Lambda](https://async-aws.com/clients/lambda.html) package.
</Callout>

### From other AWS services

Functions are perfect to react to events emitted by other AWS services.

For example, you can write code that processes new SQS events, SNS messages, new uploaded files on S3, DynamoDb insert and update events, etc.

Plenty of examples are available in the "Use cases" section in the menu, get started there!
