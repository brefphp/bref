# Deploying Laravel applications

Deploying Laravel applications requires a few changes for everything to work perfectly.

First let's change `bootstrap/app.php` to use the Bref application class:

```diff
- $app = new Illuminate\Foundation\Application(
+ $app = new Bref\Bridge\Laravel\Application(
    $_ENV['APP_BASE_PATH'] ?? dirname(__DIR__)
);
```

This class extends the Laravel application class to set a few Bref-specific helpers. Everything else stays Laravel.

Then let's write the `bref.php` file. This file will now be the entrypoint of the application and replace `public/index.php`. Here is what it should contain:

```php
<?php

define('LARAVEL_START', microtime(true));

require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

$app = require_once __DIR__.'/bootstrap/app.php';

// Laravel does not create that directory automatically so we have to create it
// You can remove this if you do not use views in your application (e.g. for an API)
if (!is_dir(storage_path('framework/views'))) {
    if (!mkdir(storage_path('framework/views'), 0755, true)) {
        die('Cannot create directory ' . storage_path('framework/views'));
    }
}

$bref = new \Bref\Application;
$bref->httpHandler($app->getBrefHttpAdapter());
$bref->run();
```

When generating the optimized config absolute paths will be everywhere, and they will not work because your machine and the lambda environment do not match. To avoid that problem, change `bootstrap/app.php` as shown below. The `APP_DIR` variable will allow us to replace the absolute path by `.` (relative path) when generating the lambda.

```diff
$app = new Bref\Bridge\Laravel\Application(
-    $_ENV['APP_BASE_PATH'] ?? dirname(__DIR__)
+    env('APP_DIR', realpath(__DIR__.'/../'))
);
```

The filesystem is readonly on lambdas except for `/tmp`. Because of that you need to customize the storage path. Add this line in `bootstrap/app.php` after `$app = new Bref\Bridge\Laravel\Application`:

```php
/*
 * Allow overriding the storage path in production using an environment variable.
 */
$app->useStoragePath(env('APP_STORAGE', $app->storagePath()));
```

Then define the `APP_STORAGE` environment variable in the `serverless.yml` file:

```yaml
functions:
  main:
    ...
    # Laravel configuration using environment variables:
    environment:
      APP_DIR: '.'
      APP_STORAGE: '/tmp/storage'
```

Edit `serverless.yml` to include the Laravel folders:

```yaml
package:
  exclude:
    # ...
  include:
    - bref.php
    # Add the following lines:
    - 'app/**'
    - 'bootstrap/**'
    - 'composer.json' # Laravel sometimes uses it to figure out the root directory
    - 'config/**'
    - 'resources/**'
    - 'routes/**'
    - 'vendor/**'
```

We need to build the config cache before deploying. Create the file `.bref.yml` and add the following [build hooks](#build-hooks) in it:

```yaml
hooks:
    build:
        # Use the `.env.production` file as `.env`
        - 'rm .env && cp .env.production .env'
        - 'rm bootstrap/cache/*.php'
        - 'php artisan config:cache'
```

Since we are writing the config cache to disk, all the paths in the config file will be resolved. Since those paths do not exist on our machine (they exist on the lambda environment only) we will have fake paths in the cached config. This is a problem in `config/views.php` because `realpath()` is used. We need to remove the `realpath()` call:

```diff
-    'compiled' => env(
-    'VIEW_COMPILED_PATH',
-    realpath(storage_path('framework/views'))
+    'compiled' => storage_path('framework/views'),
```

Write a `.env.production` file and make sure to set the following variables:

```dotenv
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
# Don't forget to set your app key
APP_KEY=
# We cannot store sessions to disk: if you don't need sessions (API, etc.) use `array`, else store sessions in database
SESSION_DRIVER=array
# Logging to stderr allows the logs to end up in Cloudwatch
LOG_CHANNEL=stderr
# This allows to generate relative file paths for the lambda
APP_DIR=.
APP_STORAGE=/tmp/storage
```

Since AWS requires a suffix to the URLs (e.g. `/dev` or `/prod`) the default route will not work out of the box. We can change the route for the welcome page:

```php
// routes/web.php

Route::get('/dev', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});
```

However if you setup a custom domain in API Gateway the `/dev` prefix will disappear.
