## [Bref 1.0 is released ðŸŽ‰](01-bref-1.0.md)

Bref started in November 2017, 3 years ago. Back then, running PHP on AWS Lambda was experimental at best.

Over the years, as the Bref community grew, as AWS features landed, and as contributors worked, creating serverless PHP applications has become a reality. Bref 0.2 has seen 37 releases. Bref 0.5 has 33. In total, we've released 89 versions since the project started.

Needless to say **Bref is stable** and has been for a long time.

Today, we're finally releasing **Bref 1.0**!
