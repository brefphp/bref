# Setup

To use Bref, you will need an AWS account and the `serverless` CLI. Let's get started:

<Steps>

    ### AWS account

    Bref deploys your applications to your AWS account. To create one, **go to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) and click *Sign up***.

    AWS has a generous free tier that will usually allow you to deploy your first serverless applications for free.

    ### Serverless CLI

    Bref relies on the [Serverless framework](https://serverless.com/) and AWS access keys to deploy applications. You will need to install the `serverless` CLI using NPM:

    ```bash
    npm install -g serverless@3
    ```

    Bref is compatible with Serverless Framework v3 and v4. However the Bref documentation is written for v3 as v4 switches to a proprietary license.

    If you don't want to install `serverless` via NPM, you can install it as a standalone binary [by following this documentation](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/v3/docs/install-standalone.md).

    ### AWS credentials

    Finally, we need AWS credentials so that the `serverless` CLI can deploy to AWS.

        If you have already set up AWS credentials on your machine (for example if you use the `aws` CLI), you can skip this step.
    </Callout>

    - [Create AWS access keys](./setup/aws-keys.mdx)

    - Set up those keys by running:

        ```bash
        serverless config credentials --provider aws --key "key" --secret "secret"
        ```

        This will store the credentials in `~/.aws/credentials` (the [official file for AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)). This is the same as running the `aws configure` command with the `aws` CLI.

        Alternatively (for example in CI/CD), you can store credentials in environment variables:

        ```bash
        export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=key
        export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=secret
        ```

</Steps>
