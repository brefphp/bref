# CLI commands

We can run CLI commands and scripts on AWS Lambda by deploying a "console" function with `serverless.yml`.

```yml
functions:
    cli:
        handler: the-php-script-to-run.php
        runtime: php-84-console
```

The function uses the [Console runtime](../runtimes/console.mdx).

To execute the script on Lambda, run the command below:

```bash
serverless bref:cli
```

We can also pass arguments to the script:

```bash
serverless bref:cli --args="extra command line arguments and options"
```

Our script will be invoked inside AWS Lambda and the result will be printed to the console.

To learn more, read [the "Console" guide](../runtimes/console.mdx).
