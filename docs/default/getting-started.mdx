# Getting started - Bref with any framework

This guide will help you deploy your first PHP application on AWS Lambda. The instructions below can be adapted to work with any framework.

If you are using Laravel or Symfony, check out the dedicated guides instead:

<Cards num={2}>
    <Card icon={<LaravelIcon />} title="Get started with Laravel" arrow="true" href="/docs/laravel/getting-started" />
    <Card icon={<SymfonyIcon />} title="Get started with Symfony" arrow="true" href="/docs/symfony/getting-started" />
</Cards>

## Setup

First, **follow the [Setup guide](../setup.mdx)** to create an AWS account and install the necessary tools.

Next, in an empty directory, install Bref using Composer:

```bash
composer require bref/bref
```

Make sure that the version of Bref that was installed is 1.0 or greater.

Then let's start by initializing a new project by running:

```bash
vendor/bin/bref init
```

Accept all the defaults by pressing "Enter". The following files will be created in your project:

- `index.php` contains the code of your application
- `serverless.yml` contains the configuration for deploying on AWS

You are free to edit `index.php`.

To deploy an existing application, you can delete `index.php` and edit `serverless.yml` to point to your existing index file (for example it may be another file like `public/index.php`). You can also create the `serverless.yml` file manually:

```yml filename="serverless.yml"
service: app
provider:
    name: aws
    region: us-east-1

functions:
    web:
        handler: index.php
        runtime: php-84-fpm
        events:
            -   httpApi: '*'

package:
    patterns: # Exclude files from deployment
        - '!node_modules/**'
        - '!tests/**'

plugins:
    - ./vendor/bref/bref
```

## Deployment

To deploy, run:

<Tabs items={['Serverless CLI', 'Bref Cloud']}>
    <Tab>
        ```bash
        serverless deploy
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash
        bref deploy
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

Once the command finishes, it should print a URL like this one:

```sh
https://3pjp2yiw97.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

Open this URL and you should see your application: `index.php` is running on Lambda!

Congrats on creating your first serverless application ðŸŽ‰

To learn more about deployments, head over the [Deployment guide](../deploy.mdx).

## Troubleshooting

In case your application is showing a blank page after being deployed, [have a look at the logs](../environment/logs.md).

## Website assets

Have a look at the [Website guide](../use-cases/websites.mdx) to learn how to deploy a website with assets.
