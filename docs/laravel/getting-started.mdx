# Serverless Laravel - Getting started

This guide helps you run Laravel applications on AWS Lambda using Bref. These instructions are kept up to date to target the latest Laravel version.

<Callout>
    A demo application is available on GitHub at [github.com/brefphp/examples](https://github.com/brefphp/examples).
</Callout>

## Setup

First, **follow the [Setup guide](../setup.mdx)** to create an AWS account and install the necessary tools.

Next, in an existing Laravel project, install Bref and the [Laravel-Bref package](https://github.com/brefphp/laravel-bridge).

```bash
composer require bref/bref bref/laravel-bridge --update-with-dependencies
```

Then let's create a [`serverless.yml` configuration file](../environment/serverless-yml.mdx):

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=serverless-config
```

### How it works

By default, the Laravel-Bref package will automatically configure Laravel to work on AWS Lambda.

If you are curious, the package will automatically:

- enable the `stderr` log driver, to send logs to CloudWatch ([read more about logs](../environment/logs.md))
- enable the [`cookie` session driver](https://laravel.com/docs/session#configuration) (if you prefer, you can configure sessions to be stored in database, DynamoDB or Redis)
- move the storage directory to `/tmp` (because the default storage directory is read-only on Lambda)
- adjust a few more settings ([have a look at the `BrefServiceProvider` for details](https://github.com/brefphp/laravel-bridge/blob/master/src/BrefServiceProvider.php))

## Deployment

We do not want to deploy "dev" caches that were generated on our machine (because paths will be different on AWS Lambda). Let's clear them before deploying:

```bash
php artisan config:clear
```

When running in AWS Lambda, the Laravel application will automatically cache its configuration when booting. You don't need to run `php artisan config:cache` before deploying.

Let's deploy now:

```bash
serverless deploy
```

When finished, the `deploy` command will show the URL of the application.

### Deploying for production

At the moment, we deployed our local codebase to Lambda. When deploying for production, we probably don't want to deploy:

- development dependencies,
- our local `.env` file,
- or any other dev artifact.

Follow [the deployment guide](/docs/deploy.md#deploying-for-production) for more details about deploying in general.

Specifically for Laravel, Bref will automatically cache the configuration on "cold starts". This means that you don't need to run `php artisan config:cache` before deploying. However, if you want to improve the cold start time you can pre-generate the config cache before deploying:

```bash
php artisan config:clear && php artisan config:cache
```

<Callout type="warning">
    Laravel will hardcode absolute paths in the cached configuration. To deploy a valid cached configuration, you should run the commands above in Docker, with the application mounted in `/var/task` (the same path as on AWS Lambda).
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

In case your application is showing a blank page after being deployed, [have a look at the logs](../environment/logs.md).

## Website assets

Have a look at the [Website guide](../use-cases/websites.mdx) to learn how to deploy a website with assets.

## Laravel Artisan

As you may have noticed, we define a function named "artisan" in `serverless.yml`. That function is using the [Console runtime](../runtimes/console.mdx), which lets us run Laravel Artisan on AWS Lambda.

For example, to execute an `artisan` command on Lambda, run the command below:

```bash
serverless bref:cli --args="<artisan command and options>"
```

For example:

```bash
serverless bref:cli --args="route:list"
```

For more details follow [the "Console" guide](../runtimes/console.mdx).

## Inertia

Laravel with Inertia runs without issue, like any other website. Follow the [Websites guide](../use-cases/websites.mdx) to learn how to deploy a Laravel with assets with Bref.
