# Laravel Passport

Laravel Passport has a `passport:install` command. However, this command cannot be run in Lambda because it needs to write files to the `storage/` directory.

Instead, here is what you need to do:

<Steps>

    ### Generate keys locally

    Run the following command on your machine to generate key files:

    ```bash
    php artisan passport:keys
    ```

    This will generate the `storage/oauth-private.key` and `storage/oauth-public.key` files, which need to be deployed.

    Depending on how you deploy your application (from your machine, or from CI), you may want to whitelist them in `serverless.yml`:

    ```yml filename="serverless.yml"
    package:
        patterns:
            - ...
            # Exclude the 'storage' directory
            - '!storage/**'
            # Except the public and private keys required by Laravel Passport
            - 'storage/oauth-private.key'
            - 'storage/oauth-public.key'
    ```

    ### Deploy

    You can now redeploy the application:

    <Tabs items={['Serverless CLI', 'Bref Cloud']}>
        <Tab>
            ```bash
            serverless deploy
            ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab>
            ```bash
            bref deploy
            ```
        </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Note, that during deployment the keys will be stored at `./storage` path, not at `/var/task/storage`. Workaround for this is to adjust Passport path with `Passport::loadKeysFrom('storage')`.

    ### Create tokens

    Finally, you can create the tokens (which is the second part of the `passport:install` command):

    <Tabs items={['Serverless CLI', 'Bref Cloud']}>
        <Tab>
            ```bash
            serverless bref:cli --args="passport:client --personal --name 'Laravel Personal Access Client'"
            serverless bref:cli --args="passport:client --password --name 'Laravel Personal Access Client'"
            ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab>
            ```bash
            bref command "passport:client --personal --name 'Laravel Personal Access Client'"
            bref command "passport:client --password --name 'Laravel Personal Access Client'"
            ```
        </Tab>
    </Tabs>

</Steps>

All these steps were replacements of running the `passport:install` command [from the Passport documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/passport#installation).
