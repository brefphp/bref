# Upgrading to Bref 3.0

## Smaller breaking changes that might impact you

The changes below should not impact the majority of users. However, if you are using any of these features, you might need to update your code.

### Changed the AWS account ID for AWS Lambda layers

The AWS account ID where Bref layers are published is different for v3. That lets us keep releasing Bref v2 layers without mixing up layer numbers.

For Bref v3 layers, you need to use `873528684822` as the AWS account number (instead of `534081306603`).

```bash
# Bref v2 layer
arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-2:534081306603:layer:php-84:xxx

# Bref v3 layer
arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-2:873528684822:layer:php-84:xxx
```
