# Serverless Symfony - Getting started

This guide helps you run Symfony applications on AWS Lambda using Bref. These instructions are kept up to date to target the latest Symfony version.

<Callout>
    A demo application is available on GitHub at [github.com/brefphp/examples](https://github.com/brefphp/examples).
</Callout>

## Setup

First, **follow the [Setup guide](../setup.md)** to create an AWS account and install the necessary tools.

Next, in an existing Symfony project, install Bref and the [Symfony Bridge package](https://github.com/brefphp/symfony-bridge).

```bash
composer require bref/bref bref/symfony-bridge --update-with-dependencies
```

If you are using [Symfony Flex](https://flex.symfony.com/), it will automatically run the [bref/symfony-bridge recipe](https://github.com/symfony/recipes-contrib/tree/master/bref/symfony-bridge/0.1) which will perform the following tasks:

- Create a `serverless.yml` configuration file optimized for Symfony.
- Add the `.serverless` folder to the `.gitignore` file.

Otherwise, you can create the `serverless.yml` file manually at the root of the project. Take a look at the [default configuration](https://github.com/symfony/recipes-contrib/blob/master/bref/symfony-bridge/0.1/serverless.yaml) provided by the recipe.

You still have a few modifications to do on the application to make it compatible with AWS Lambda.

Since [the filesystem is readonly](/docs/environment/storage.md) except for `/tmp` we need to customize where the cache and logs are stored in
the `src/Kernel.php` file. This is automatically done by the bridge, you just need to use the `BrefKernel` class instead of the default `BaseKernel`:

```diff filename="src/Kernel.php"
namespace App;

+ use Bref\SymfonyBridge\BrefKernel;
use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Kernel\MicroKernelTrait;
use Symfony\Component\Config\Loader\LoaderInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Config\Resource\FileResource;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerBuilder;
-use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Kernel as BaseKernel;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\RouteCollectionBuilder;

- class Kernel extends BaseKernel
+ class Kernel extends BrefKernel
{
    // ...
```

## Deployment

Let's deploy the application to AWS Lambda:

```bash
serverless deploy
```

When finished, the `deploy` command will show the URL of the application.

### Deploying for production

At the moment, we deployed our local codebase to Lambda. When deploying for production, we probably don't want to deploy:

- development dependencies,
- our local `.env` files,
- or any other dev artifact.

Follow [the deployment guide](/docs/deploy.md#deploying-for-production) for more details.

Note as well that for better performance in production, you can warmup the Symfony cache before deploying:

```bash
php bin/console cache:warmup --env=prod
```

## Troubleshooting

In case your application is showing a blank page after being deployed, [have a look at the logs](../environment/logs.md).

## Symfony Console

As you may have noticed, we define a function named "console" in `serverless.yml`. That function is using the [Console runtime](/docs/web-apps/console.md),
which lets us run the Symfony Console on AWS Lambda.

For example, to execute an `bin/console` command on Lambda, run the command below:

```bash
serverless bref:cli --args="<console command and options>"
```

For more details follow [the "Console" guide](/docs/web-apps/console.md).

TODO

## Logs

By default, Symfony logs to `stderr`. That is great because Bref [automatically forwards `stderr` to AWS CloudWatch](/docs/environment/logs.md).

However, if your application is using Monolog, you need to configure it to log to `stderr` as well:

```yml filename="config/packages/prod/monolog.yaml" {6}
monolog:
  handlers:
    # ...
    nested:
      type: stream
      path: php://stderr
```

## Trust API Gateway

When hosting a website on Lambda, API Gateway acts as a proxy between the client and your Lambda function.

By default, Symfony doesn't trust proxies for security reasons, but it's safe to do it when using API Gateway and Lambda. This is needed because otherwise, Symfony will not be able to generate URLs properly.

Add the following lines to `config/packages/framework.yaml`:

```yml filename="config/packages/framework.yaml" {2-5}
framework:
  # trust the remote address because API Gateway has no fixed IP or CIDR range that we can target
  trusted_proxies: '127.0.0.1'
  # trust "X-Forwarded-*" headers coming from API Gateway
  trusted_headers: [ 'x-forwarded-for', 'x-forwarded-proto', 'x-forwarded-port' ]
```

Note that API Gateway doesn't set the `X-Forwarded-Host` header, so we don't trust it by default. You should only whitelist this header if you set it manually,
for example in your CloudFront configuration (this is done automatically
in [the Cloudfront distribution deployed by Lift](./assets.mdx)).

You can get more details in the [Symfony documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/deployment/proxies.html).

<Callout>
    Be careful with these settings if your app is also executed outside a Lambda environment (for example on a public server).
</Callout>

### Getting the user IP

**When using CloudFront** on top of API Gateway, you will not be able to retrieve the client IP address, and you will instead get one of CloudFront's IP when
calling `Request::getClientIp()`. If you really need this, you will need to
whitelist [every CloudFront IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/LocationsOfEdgeServers.html)
in `trusted_proxies`.

## The `kernel.terminate` event

The [`kernel.terminate` event](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_kernel.html#component-http-kernel-kernel-terminate) runs **synchronously** on Lambda.

That means that if you use this event, its listeners will be executed **before** the Lambda function returns its response. That will add latency to your response.

To run asynchronous tasks, use the [Symfony Messenger](./messenger.mdx) instead.
