introduction: Learn how to deploy serverless Laravel applications on AWS Lambda using Bref.
---

This guide helps you run Laravel applications on AWS Lambda using Bref. These instructions are kept up to date to target the latest Laravel version.

A demo application is available on GitHub at [github.com/brefphp/examples](https://github.com/brefphp/examples).

## Setup

Assuming your are in existing Laravel project, let's install Bref via Composer:

```
composer require bref/bref
```

Then let's create a `serverless.yml` configuration file (at the root of the project) optimized for Laravel:

```yaml
service: bref-demo-laravel

provider:
    name: aws
    region: us-east-1
    runtime: provided

plugins:
    - ./vendor/bref/bref

package:
  exclude:
    - node_modules/**
    - public/storage
    - resources/assets/**
    - storage/**
    - tests/**

functions:
    website:
        handler: public/index.php
        timeout: 28 # in seconds (API Gateway has a timeout of 29 seconds)
        layers:
            - ${bref:layer.php-73-fpm}
        events:
            -   http: 'ANY /'
            -   http: 'ANY /{proxy+}'
    artisan:
        handler: artisan
        timeout: 120 # in seconds
        layers:
            - ${bref:layer.php-73} # PHP
            - ${bref:layer.console} # The "console" layer
```

We will also need to customize the location for compiled views, as well as customize a few variables in the `.env` file:

```dotenv
VIEW_COMPILED_PATH=/tmp/storage/framework/views

# We cannot store sessions to disk: if you don't need sessions (e.g. API) then use `array`
# If you write a website, use `cookie` or store sessions in database.
SESSION_DRIVER=cookie

# Logging to stderr allows the logs to end up in Cloudwatch
LOG_CHANNEL=stderr
```

Finally we need to edit `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` because Laravel will not create that directory automatically:

```php
    public function boot()
    {
        // Make sure the directory for compiled views exist
        if (! is_dir(config('view.compiled'))) {
            mkdir(config('view.compiled'), 0755, true);
        }
    }
```

## Deployment

At the moment deploying Laravel with its caches will break in AWS Lambda (because most file paths are different). This is why it is currently necessary to deploy without the config cache file. However, deploying Laravel without it's packages and services cache will also break in Lambda. The solution is to run `php artisan config:cache` to build all caches (not only config) and then `php artisan config:clear` to make sure that config cache file doesn't exist.

Your application is now ready to be deployed. Follow [the deployment guide](/docs/deploy.md).

## Troubleshooting

In case your application is showing a blank page after being deployed, [have a look at the logs](../environment/logs.md).

If you get the following error:

> production.ERROR: mkdir(): Invalid path {"exception":"[object] (ErrorException(code: 0): mkdir(): Invalid path at /var/task/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php:20)"

then check the file `config/view.php` and make sure the `'compiled'` entry looks like this:

```php
    'compiled' => env(
        'VIEW_COMPILED_PATH',
        realpath(storage_path('framework/views'))
    ),
```

### HTTPS

If your application creates links and redirections to HTTP URLs (which are invalid), you should configure the `app/Http/Middleware/TrustProxies.php` file to accept the AWS API Gateway headers:

```diff
-    protected $proxies;
+    protected $proxies = '*';
```

### Forwarding correct Host header

When not enabling host forwarding, Laravel will use the hostname/domain from Cloudfront while building internal links (routes).
To fix this, you can use one of the following methods. Please also have a look at the HTTPS section above for allowing the AWS proxies.

#### Method 1: Extending serverless.yml

You can add the following `OriginCustomHeaders` part to your `Origins` setting in your `serverless.yml` file:

```diff
Origins:
  # The website (AWS Lambda)
  - Id: Website
    DomainName: '#{ApiGatewayRestApi}.execute-api.#{AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com'
    OriginPath: '/dev'
    CustomOriginConfig:
      OriginProtocolPolicy: 'https-only' # API Gateway only supports HTTPS
+    OriginCustomHeaders:
+      - HeaderName: 'X-Forwarded-Host'
+        HeaderValue: 'your-domain-here.com'
```

#### Method 2: Customizing the Cloudfront Distribution (whitelisting `Host` header forwarding)

You can whitelist the `Host` header in your Cloudfront Distribution like this (to forward the `Host` header from the request):

- Open the Amazon CloudFront console, and then choose your distribution.
- Choose the Behaviors view, and then choose the path you are using.
- Choose Edit.
- For Cache Based on Selected Request Headers, choose Whitelist.
- Under Whitelist Headers, choose Host from the column on the left, and then choose Add.
- Choose Yes, Edit.

## Laravel Artisan

As you may have noticed, we define a function of type "console" in `serverless.yml`. That function is using the [Console runtime](/docs/runtimes/console.md), which lets us run Laravel Artisan on AWS Lambda.

For example, to execute an `artisan` command on Lambda for the above configuration, run the below command.

```
vendor/bin/bref cli bref-demo-laravel-artisan <bref options> -- <your command, your options>
```

For more details follow [the "Console" guide](/docs/runtimes/console.md).

## Assets

To deploy Laravel websites, we need assets to be served by AWS S3. Setting up the S3 bucket is already explained in the [websites documentation](../websites.md#hosting-static-files-with-s3). This section provides additional instructions specific to Laravel Mix.

First, you can compile assets for production in the `public` directory, then synchronize that directory to a S3 bucket:

```bash
npm run prod
aws s3 sync public/ s3://<bucket-name>/ --delete --exclude index.php
```

Then, the assets need to be included from S3. Update `config/app.php` to add this variable:

```php
    'mix_url' => env('MIX_ASSET_URL', null),
```

In the production `.env` file you can now set that variable:

```dotenv
MIX_ASSET_URL=https://<bucket-name>.s3.amazonaws.com
```

### Assets in templates

Assets referenced in templates should be via the `asset()` helper:

```html
<script src="{{ asset('js/app.js') }}"></script>
```

If your templates reference some assets via direct path, you should edit them to use the `asset()` helper:

```html
- <img src="/images/logo.png">
+ <img src="{{ asset('images/logo.png') }}">
```

## File storage on S3

Laravel has a [filesystem abstraction](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/filesystem) that lets us easily change where files are stored. When running on Lambda, you will need to use the `s3` adapter to store files on AWS S3. To do this, configure you production `.env` file:

```dotenv
# .env
FILESYSTEM_DRIVER=s3
```

Next, we need to create our bucket via `serverless.yml`:

```yaml
...

provider:
    ...
    environment:
        AWS_BUCKET: # environment variable for Laravel
            Ref: Storage
    iamRoleStatements:
        # Allow Lambda to read and write files in the S3 buckets
        -   Effect: Allow
            Action: s3:*
            Resource:
                - Fn::GetAtt: Storage.Arn # the storage bucket
                - Fn::Join: ['', [Fn::GetAtt: Storage.Arn, '/*']] # everything in the storage bucket

resources:
    Resources:
        Storage:
            Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
```

Because [of a misconfiguration shipped in Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/pull/5138), the S3 authentication will not work out of the box. You will need to add this line in `config/filesystems.php`:

```diff
        's3' => [
            'driver' => 's3',
            'key' => env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
            'secret' => env('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
+           'token' => env('AWS_SESSION_TOKEN'),
            'region' => env('AWS_DEFAULT_REGION'),
            'bucket' => env('AWS_BUCKET'),
            'url' => env('AWS_URL'),
        ],
```

That's it! The `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID', 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' and 'AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` variables are defined automatically on AWS Lambda, you don't have to define them.

### Public files

Laravel has a [special disk called `public`](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/filesystem#the-public-disk): this disk stores files that we want to make public, like uploaded photos, generated PDF files, etc.

Again, those files cannot be stored on Lambda, i.e. they cannot be stored in the default `storage/app/public` directory. You need to store those files on S3.

> Do not run `php artisan storage:link` on AWS Lambda: it is now useless, and it will fail because the filesystem is read-only on Lambda.

To store public files on S3, you could simply replace the disk in the code:

```diff
- Storage::disk('public')->put('avatars/1', $fileContents);
+ Storage::disk('s3')->put('avatars/1', $fileContents);
```

but doing this will not let your application work locally. A better solution, but more complex, involves making the `public` disk configurable. Let's change the configuration in `config/filesystems.php`:

```diff
    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Default Public Filesystem Disk
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    */

+   'public' => env('FILESYSTEM_DRIVER_PUBLIC', 'public_local'),

    ...

    'disks' => [

        'local' => [
            'driver' => 'local',
            'root' => storage_path('app'),
        ],

-        'public' => [
+        'public_local' => [
            'driver' => 'local',
            'root' => storage_path('app/public'),
            'url' => env('APP_URL').'/storage',
            'visibility' => 'public',
        ],

        's3' => [
            'driver' => 's3',
            'key' => env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
            'secret' => env('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
            'token' => env('AWS_SESSION_TOKEN'),
            'region' => env('AWS_DEFAULT_REGION'),
            'bucket' => env('AWS_BUCKET'),
            'url' => env('AWS_URL'),
        ],

+        's3_public' => [
+            'driver' => 's3',
+            'key' => env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
+            'secret' => env('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
+            'token' => env('AWS_SESSION_TOKEN'),
+            'region' => env('AWS_DEFAULT_REGION'),
+            'bucket' => env('AWS_PUBLIC_BUCKET'),
+            'url' => env('AWS_URL'),
+        ],

    ],
```

You can now configure the `public` disk to use S3 by changing your production `.env`:

```dotenv
FILESYSTEM_DRIVER=s3
FILESYSTEM_DRIVER_PUBLIC=s3
```

## Laravel Queues

It is possible to run Laravel Queues on AWS Lambda using [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/).

A dedicated Bref package is available for this: [bref/laravel-bridge](https://github.com/brefphp/laravel-bridge).

## Laravel Passport

Laravel Passport has a `passport:install` command. However, this command cannot be run in Lambda because it needs to write files to the `storage/` directory.

Instead, here is what you need to do:

- Run `php artisan passport:keys` locally to generate key files.

    This command will generate the `storage/oauth-private.key` and `storage/oauth-public.key` files, which need to be deployed.

    Depending on how you deploy your application (from your machine, or from CI), you may want to whitelist them in `serverless.yml`:
    
    ```yaml
      package:
          exclude:
              ...
          include:
              - storage/oauth-private.key
              - storage/oauth-public.key  
      ```

- You can now deploy the application:

    ```yaml
    serverless deploy
    ```

- Finally, you can create the tokens (which is the second part of the `passport:install` command):

   ```bash
   vendor/bin/bref cli <artisan-function-name> -- passport:client --personal --name 'Laravel Personal Access Client'
   vendor/bin/bref cli <artisan-function-name> -- passport:client --password --name 'Laravel Personal Access Client'
   ```

All these steps were replacements of running the `passport:install` command [from the Passport documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/passport#installation).
