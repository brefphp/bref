# AWS suggests this file not be stored within the project itself for AWS Public CodeBuild
# (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/public-builds.html).
# However, what protects us here is the fact that this build WILL ONLY be executed if a PULL_REQUEST_MERGED event
# is triggered. Therefore, only AFTER a Bref Maintainer has approved and merged the changes this file will
# be executed. Changes made here that are not merged does not run the public build.
# Even if a "contributor" makes changes to the release.yml template itself to include more triggers, it requires
# manually applying those changes to AWS CloudFormation before they take effect.
